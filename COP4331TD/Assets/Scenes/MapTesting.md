The Map00a scene is meant for map testing, and will change constantly as a result
We will not have Map00 as a playable map, reasoning is above

If absolutely needed, another scene can be created if testing multiple maps at
the same time. Naming convention should be Map00(a-z), where a-z is which
number of map is being tested. Map00a, then Map00b, and so on.

Try to keep the amount of testing maps to a minimum, as too many projects at
once can easily slow down production
