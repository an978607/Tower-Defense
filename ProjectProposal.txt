Vision Statement

Our product is for gamers who are seeking a free and engaging browser-based tower defense experience. Being composed of tower defense fans, our team saw that there was no game available that was more engaging than dragging and dropping defensive mechanisms in a field and watching the action unfold. We also noted that most games were not visually impressive, usually sticking to two-dimensional graphics and bland graphical features. We werenâ€™t impressed and we feel gamers deserve a more creative and immersive experience.

With 3D Tower Defense, we aim to solve these problems and provide a more engaging experience for all gamers. First, the game will be fully rendered in 3D and have multiple viewing angles as opposed to only a top-facing view. Next, we will allow gamers to have full control over the defense mechanisms placed on the field. Instead of the game being a linear experience, the game will now rely on quick decision-making by the user. We feel that these features will improve the overall tower defense experience and provide a more fun experience for tower defense fans.
