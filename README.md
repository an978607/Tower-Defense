# Tower-Defense
COP4331C Spring 2021 Project

# Product Vision

Our product is for gamers who are seeking a free and engaging tower defense experience. Being composed of tower defense fans, our team saw that there was no game available that was more engaging than dragging and dropping defensive mechanisms in a field and watching the action unfold. We also noted that most games were not visually impressive, usually sticking to two-dimensional graphics and bland graphical features. We werenâ€™t impressed and we feel gamers deserve a more creative and immersive experience.

With 3D Tower Defense, we aim to solve these problems and provide a more engaging experience for all gamers. First, the game will be fully rendered in 3D and have multiple viewing angles as opposed to only a top-facing view. Next, we will allow gamers to have full control over the defense mechanisms placed on the field. Instead of the game being a linear experience, the game will now rely on quick decision-making by the user. We feel that these features will improve the overall tower defense experience and provide a more fun experience for tower defense fans.
